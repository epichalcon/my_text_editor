![Work In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Work%20In%20Progress-orange?style=for-the-badge)

This proyect is a rust written text editor. The goal is to write a text editor following the ["Build your own text editor"](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) porting the code to rust. This way I intend to learn what goes in writing a text editor and I can practice and carry on learning rust.

The commands to use the editor are the following:
- Ctrl-Q: Quit (if the file has not been saved, a warning message will be displayed)
- Ctrl-S: Save (if it is a new file the user will be promped to provide a name for the file)
- Ctrl-F: Search
