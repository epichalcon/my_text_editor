![Work In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Work%20In%20Progress-orange?style=for-the-badge)

This proyect is a rust written text editor. The goal is to write a text editor following the ["Build your own text editor"](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) porting the code to rust. This way I intend to learn what goes in writing a text editor and I can practice and carry on learning rust.
